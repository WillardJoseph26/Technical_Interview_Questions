#### Math Stack

Implement a class called `MathStack` that allows for certain operations. Given a stack of integers, use the [STL stack](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/) and its provided functionality to find the minimum element in a stack.

You may ONLY use stacks to complete this project (no other data structures, such as vectors or lists, are allowed). Moreover, the input stack MUST remain unchanged from its original state after the function returns; in other words, the stack has the same values in the same order after the function has completed.

#### BounceBackStack

Contains two structures internally, a stack and a random access array/vector.
Can perform push/pop/stackSize, and also insertFront/insertAt/insertBack/
totalSize/totalCapacity/randomAccessSize. Given an overall capacity, maintain
this structure accordingly.
